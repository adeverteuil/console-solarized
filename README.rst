Introduction
============

This is a port of the Solarized colorscheme for the
Linux console. Developed by Alexandre de Verteuil
alexandre.deverteuil@gmail.com.

Original Solarized colorscheme developed by: **Ethan Schoonover**.

See the `Solarized homepage`_ for screenshots, details and colorscheme
versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and other
applications.

Installing
==========

Method 1: ``/etc/issue``
------------------------

1. Move ``/etc/issue`` to ``/etc/issue.backup``.
2. Write the output of ``console-solarized`` to ``/etc/issue``::

    # console-solarized [dark|light] > /etc/issue

   You may get better results if you put the clear screen escape sequences first::

    # clear > /etc/issue
    # console-solarized [dark|light] >> /etc/issue
    # cat /etc/issue.backup >> /etc/issue

Method 2: systemd unit
----------------------

.. Note::

    This installation procedure is for a systemd_ managed Linux
    distribution such as ArchLinux_.

.. _systemd: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd
.. _ArchLinux: https://www.archlinux.org/

1. Copy the source files to the directories indicated by the following table.
   You should edit ``/etc/console-solarized.conf`` if you wish to use the light theme.
   The dark theme is enabled by default.

   ===========================  =====================================  ====
   File list                    Location to copy to                    Edit
   ===========================  =====================================  ====
   console-solarized            /usr/local/bin/
   console-solarized.conf       /etc/                                  yes
   console-solarized@.service   /etc/systemd/system/
   solarized.conf               /etc/systemd/system/getty@.service.d/
   ===========================  =====================================  ====

2. Run ``systemctl daemon-reload`` as root to make systemd reload the
   configuration files.

**Bug**: It should be written in C.

Choosing theme
==============

``console-solarized`` will prioritize the argument for setting the theme.
If no argument is provided, ``/etc/console-solarized.conf`` is used.

Method 1: first argument
------------------------

Set Solarized dark::

    $ console-solarized dark

or Solarized light::

    $ console-solarized light

Method 2: ``/etc/console-solarized.conf``
-----------------------------------------

1. Copy ``console-solarized.conf`` to ``/etc/console-solarized.conf``.
2. Configure to your taste.
